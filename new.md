# Interactive Assets Plan

To make the game more interactive and premium, we need to integrate Audio (SFX & Voice) and enhanced Visual assets.

## 1. Audio Generation & Assets (Cannot be generated by Agent directly)

Since I cannot generate audio files directly, here is **What** you need and **How** to generate them:

### A. Sound Effects (SFX)
**What needed:**
1.  **Click Sound**: Subtle click for buttons.
2.  **Success Chime**: Positive sound when a word is predicted correctly.
3.  **Error Buzz**: When a wrong letter is typed/signed.
4.  **Timer Tick**: Ticking sound for the last 10 seconds.
5.  **Level Up / Win**: Fanfare when completing a category.
6.  **AI Thinking**: A digital processing sound for the new AI feature.

**How to Generate:**
*   **Web Audio API (Code)**: *I can implement this for you.* We can synthesize simple beeps and tones directly in JavaScript without external files.
*   **sfxr.me / bfxr.net**: Free browser tools to generate retro/arcade sound effects instantly.
*   **ElevenLabs / OpenAI TTS**: Use these for specific voice interactions.

### B. Voiceovers (Optional but Premium)
**What needed:**
*   "Correct!"
*   "Try Again."
*   "Game Over."
*   "New High Score!"

**How to Generate:**
*   **ElevenLabs**: Use a high-quality "Narrator" voice.
*   **Standard Browser TTS**: Use `speechSynthesis` API in JavaScript (free, no files needed).

### C. Background Ambience
**What needed:**
*   Soft, non-distracting Lo-Fi or ambient electronic track.

**How to Generate:**
*   **Suno AI / Udio**: Prompt: *"Lo-fi chill beat for puzzle game, no lyrics, calming, endless loop"*.

## 2. Image Assets (I can generate these)

I will proceed to generate the following assets to enhance the visual experience:

1.  **AI Mascot Icon (`ai_mascot.png`)**: A cute, futuristic robot or brain icon to represent the Perplexity AI helper.
2.  **Premium Glass Background (`glass_bg.png`)**: A high-quality abstract background with purple/cyan gradients to match the "Indigo/Purple/Cyan" theme.
3.  **Rank Medals**: Custom gold, silver, and bronze medal icons for the leaderboard.

## 3. Implementation Plan
1.  **Images**: I will generate the AI Mascot and Background now.
2.  **Audio**: I will add a `SoundManager` class to `js/sound_manager.js` that uses the **Web Audio API** to synthesize sounds (Click, Success, Error) so you don't need to download files.
