# Alternative requirements for cloud deployment (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, etc.)
# Use this file if you encounter PyAudio build issues in cloud environments

streamlit
streamlit-elements==0.1.*
streamlit-webrtc>=0.47.0  # Browser-based camera access for cloud deployment
aiortc>=1.3.0,<2.0.0  # WebRTC implementation - pinned for stability
aioice>=0.9.0  # ICE/STUN implementation
av  # PyAV for video frame processing
opencv-python-headless
mediapipe>=0.10.0
numpy
gTTS
# pygame  # Optional for local audio playback
# SpeechRecognition  # Requires PyAudio, optional for cloud
# pyaudio  # Requires system dependencies, not needed for cloud
flask
flask-cors
scikit-learn

# Note: PyAudio and SpeechRecognition features won't work in cloud deployments
# as they require microphone access. These are primarily for local development.
# Browser camera access via WebRTC (streamlit-webrtc) works perfectly in cloud!
# 
# Known Issue: aioice may log AttributeError warnings during connection cleanup.
# These are non-fatal and handled by our event_loop_manager utility.
